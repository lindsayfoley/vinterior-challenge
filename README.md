Hi,

Thanks for inviting me to take part in this challenge and so sorry for the essay that's ahead of you!

I normally approach a task like this by breaking down the brief so I have a clear idea of the business requirements, my next steps would be to research what competitors are doing followed by wire-framing a few ideas. After having some wire-frames to use as a guide, I would then start building but due to the time restrictions on this task I skipped the research and wireframe steps to maximise the build time. Sadly I ran out of time and wasn't able to execute my full vision for this so I wanted to include some notes so you could get an idea of what I was hoping to achieve as my solution is basic at the moment:

I spent a good half an hour going through the brief and highlighting what I thought was most relevant which I've grouped below:

Aim:
- You've just started targeting a new audience and you wish 'to improve the conversion rate for our new “London beer fans” audience' - as conversion can take many different forms e.g. gain more followers/likes on FB page, more newsletter signups from users in London or higher sales volume - I assumed in this case you wanted to increase demand and/or sales from the "London beer fans" segment 

Marketing insights:
- As marketing spend the majority of your paid advertising budget on FB I understand you are looking for a good ROI
- Showcasing more options vs. a single product provides more exposure to your company. A wider choice means users are more likely to find a product that they would like to try, you can showcase ranges and product collections, show a variation of price points and allow users to filter by tastes, etc.
- You've identified some tactics that resonate with your target market - FOMO effect, you could create this by highlighting unique beers and emphasising limited availability as this would create urgency and encourage conversion 
- Trust is important target market - showing ratings/reviews and adding trust signals can reassure new users and hopefully entice them into converting

Ideas to meeasure success:
Compare performance of sending users to multi product page vs. individual product pages:
- Are we seeing an increase in demand from new visitors coming from FB since the campaign went live?
- Have we seen an increase in sales attributed to this channel?
- Are we seeing more visits from users based in London?
- Look at GA metrics that are indicative of user satisfaction e.g. time spent on page, increase in session duration, lower bounce rate, etc. to determine which campaign landing page users liked best

I planned to incorporate sorting and filtering and additional elements to make the page interesting: 

Ideas:
- Sort - price low to high, price high to low, what's new, top picks
- Filter - price, no. of reviews, rating, brewery, type e.g larger or cider, alcohol %, size of can/bottle
- Default item order to reflect bestsellers or top rated beers
- Maybe look at adding some kind of 'beer personality quiz' with series of short questions which reveals best suited beer and has share buttons - good for engagement and shareable amongst peers who are likely to be in the same demographic 

I hope this helps to illustrate the direction I was going to take with this task.

Thanks for you time, much appreciated!

Lindsay
